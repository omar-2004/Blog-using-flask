# 📚 Flask Full-Stack Application Template

Welcome to the **Flask Full-Stack Application Template**, an open-source project designed for **learning, experimentation**, and **rapid prototyping**. This project provides a **modular and scalable structure** for building Flask applications that incorporate both front-end and back-end components. It can serve as a **starting point** for various types of applications or simply as a **reference for studying Flask best practices**.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is provided **as-is** and is intended for **educational purposes**. It is not production-ready, and you should use it **at your own responsibility**. Contributions, feedback, and adaptations are welcome!

## 🚀 **Features**

- 📦 **Modular Structure:** Easily extendable using Flask Blueprints.
- 🌐 **Front-End Ready:** Supports Jinja2 templating with organized static files (CSS, JS, images).
- 🛠️ **Database Integration:** SQLAlchemy ORM with Flask-Migrate for database migrations.
- 📝 **Forms Handling:** WTForms integration for form validation and rendering.
- 🧪 **Testing Ready:** Basic test setup for unit and integration testing.
- ♻️ **App Factory Pattern:** Flexible application creation suitable for multiple environments.
